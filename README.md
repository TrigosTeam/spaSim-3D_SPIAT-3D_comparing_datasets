This repo contains R scripts for:  
- Simulation and analysis of simulated dataset 3 (SD3), found in the /SD3_comparing_simulated_datasets directory.
- Comparative analysis within public datasets, found in the /comparing_public_datasets directory.

The output of the results are found in the paper: '2D spatial tissue analysis often misrepresents true biological patterns of 3D tissues'

Note: in the /comparing_public_datasets directory, only the following R scripts were used for the paper:  
- compare_mouse_embryo_datasets.R
- compare_stomics_fly_datasets.R
